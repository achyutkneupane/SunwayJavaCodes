# Car Engine Code

## Question
Create a class “Engine” with three instance variables; modelno, brand and price. Create a parameterized constructor, getters and setters methods inside the class “Engine”.

Create another class “Car” with method runEngine(Engine e) that takes an object parameter of Engine type and prints all the state of that object. Test the method (runEngine(Engine e))inside the main method.
