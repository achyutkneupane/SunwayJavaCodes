# Merge And Sort Code

## Question
Suppose A, B, C are arrays of integers. The numbers in array A appear in ascending order while the numbers in array B appear in descending order. Write a user defined method in Java to produce third array C by merging arrays A and B in ascending order. Use A and B as arguments in the method.

## Description
This code solution has a class `MergeAndSort` with a method `mergeAndSort` which takes two arrays as arguments and returns a third array. There are also two methods `mergeArrays` and `sortInAscending` which are used to merge and sort the arrays respectively. The test value for first array is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and for second array is `{10, 9, 8, 7, 6}`.
